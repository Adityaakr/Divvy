# 🚀 Full Account Abstraction Payment System Setup

## ✅ What's Already Working
- ✅ Smart Wallet deployed: `0x9406Cc6185a346906296840746125a0E44976454`
- ✅ 100 PYUSD in smart wallet
- ✅ Owner wallet with private key
- ✅ Smart wallet contracts and infrastructure
- ✅ Full AA payment service implemented

## 🔧 What You Need to Provide

### 1. StackUp Bundler API Key (Required for UserOperations)
```bash
# Get from: https://app.stackup.sh/
# Add to your .env file:
EXPO_PUBLIC_STACKUP_BUNDLER_API_KEY="your_stackup_api_key_here"
```

### 2. Optional: Paymaster (for sponsored transactions)
```bash
# If you want gas-free transactions for users:
EXPO_PUBLIC_PAYMASTER_URL="your_paymaster_url"
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Method 1: UserOperation via Bundler (Preferred)
1. **Creates UserOperation** with your PYUSD transfer
2. **Signs with your private key** (simulating WebAuthn)
3. **Sends to StackUp bundler** via `eth_sendUserOperation`
4. **Bundler processes** and includes in blockchain
5. **Returns real transaction hash**

### Method 2: Direct Execution (Fallback)
1. **Calls `executeBatch` directly** on your smart wallet
2. **Uses owner wallet** to sign transaction
3. **Executes PYUSD transfer** immediately
4. **Returns real transaction hash**

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Get StackUp API Key
- Go to https://app.stackup.sh/
- Sign up and create a new app
- Copy your API key
- Add to `.env`: `EXPO_PUBLIC_STACKUP_BUNDLER_API_KEY="your_key"`

### 2. Test the Payment
```bash
# Restart your app
npm run start

# Go to Receipts tab
# Tap "Coffee shop bill - $12.30 PYUSD"
# Tap "Pay $12.30 PYUSD"
# Watch logs for real transaction
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### With StackUp Bundler:
```
🚀 FULL AA PAYMENT SYSTEM
FROM: 0x9406...6454 (Smart Wallet)
TO: 0x5A26...5570
AMOUNT: 12.30 PYUSD
BUNDLER: StackUp

🔄 METHOD 1: UserOperation via StackUp Bundler
📝 Creating UserOperation...
✍️ UserOperation signed
📡 Sending UserOperation to bundler...
✅ UserOperation sent: 0xabc123...
⏳ Waiting for UserOperation confirmation...
🎉 UserOperation confirmed!
Transaction Hash: 0xdef456...
```

### Without Bundler (Fallback):
```
🔄 METHOD 2: Direct Smart Wallet Execution
📝 Direct smart wallet execution...

## 🔗 Verification Links
- **Smart Wallet:** https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9406Cc6185a346906296840746125a0E44976454
- **PYUSD Token:** https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xCaC524BcA292aaade2DF8A05cC58F0a65B1B3bB9
- **Transaction:** Will show in app logs and Etherscan

## 🎯 What Happens After Payment
1. **Smart wallet balance:** 100 PYUSD → 87.7 PYUSD
2. **Recipient balance:** 0 PYUSD → 12.3 PYUSD  
3. **Receipt status:** Pending → Settled
4. **Real transaction:** Viewable on Etherscan

## 🚨 Important Notes
- This makes **REAL** transactions on Sepolia testnet
- Your smart wallet will **actually** send 12.30 PYUSD
- Transaction is **irreversible** once confirmed
- Gas fees paid from your EOA wallet (0.05 ETH available)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If bundler fails:
- Check StackUp API key is correct
- System will automatically fall back to direct execution
- Direct execution should work with your current setup

### If direct execution fails:
- Ensure smart wallet is properly deployed (✅ already done)
- Check owner wallet has ETH for gas (✅ you have 0.05 ETH)
- Verify smart wallet has PYUSD (✅ you have 100 PYUSD)

## 🎉 Ready to Test!
Your system is now fully implemented with both UserOperation and direct execution methods. Just add the StackUp API key and test!
